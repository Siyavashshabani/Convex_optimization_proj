## 📦 Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siyavashshabani/Convex_optimization_proj.git
cd Convex_optimization_proj
```


### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv conv_env
source conv_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.  📁 Repository Structure
```

│   ├── Q1.ipynb
│   ├── Q2.ipynb
│   ├── Q3.ipynb
│   ├── Q4.ipynb
│   └── Q5.ipynb
├── figures/                 # Contains generated plots/images
├── final_report.pdf         
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

### 4.  Main 

For each question, I have prepared a .ipynb file containing the implementation and its corresponding output figures. Additionally, a final report in .pdf format is included, which provides detailed descriptions, answers, and results for each question.
